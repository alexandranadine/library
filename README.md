<h1>The Odin Project: Library</h1>
<p><b>v.1:</b></p>
<p>I am creating a small library app for this project. Goals of the project were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather input from user and store it in an array</li>
<li>Display book information from array in a table or on cards (I went with cards!)</li>
<li>Be able to remove a book from your library</li>
<li>Be able to change the read status of a book</li></ul>
<p>As of 9/12/22, this project is still in progress!! In a later assignment, I will learn how to add cloud and local storage so the books can be saved.</p>
